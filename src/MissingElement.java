/*
 * There is an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the
 *  first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in 
 *  the second array.
 *  Solution: Perform an XOR operation on all the elements in the first array. XOR the result with all the 
 *  elements of the second array. The result will be the missing element since XOR of two equal numbers is 0.
